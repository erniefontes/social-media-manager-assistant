# Roadmap

- Add bulk post ingestion
- Add metrics for post engagement
- Add model to predict engaging posts
- Bring-your-own-key for API-powered LLMs including support for local LLMs like `ollama`.
- Implement more advanced NLP techniques for better post generation
- Add support for multiple social media platforms
- Develop advanced analytics for post performance
- Implement automated posting functionality
- Expand WebUI features (e.g., drag-and-drop interface for post scheduling)
- Add metrics for post performance. Use these metrics to rank past posts for generating new content. Create a model to predict engagement from draft posts. Add agentic feedback for draft posts to select ones with best engagement metrics.
- Add graphics storage + multimodal support to streamline picking graphical content to accompany posts.

## **Agentic design use cases**

- Automated Content Generation and Posting:
  - After generating a post, the assistant can automatically schedule it for publishing across different platforms.

- Autonomous Monitoring and Engagement:

  - Implement a monitoring agent that tracks social media trends, mentions, or comments in real-time.
  - The agent could generate and post responses or flag specific interactions for human review.

- Self-Improving Content Strategy:

  - An agent could analyze the performance of past posts (e.g., engagement metrics) and adjust content generation strategies accordingly.
  - It could suggest new topics or adjust the tone and style based on what resonates most with the audience.

## **Agentic design steps for use cases above**

- Agentic Layer Architecture

  - **Task Manager**: Manages tasks for the agent, such as content generation, scheduling, and monitoring. Tasks can be scheduled or triggered based on events.
  - **Decision Engine**: Determines the actions the agent should take based on predefined rules, trends, or learning from past interactions.
  - **Monitoring Module**: Continuously monitors social media platforms, user interactions, and the performance of posts.
  - **Execution Engine**: Executes the actions decided by the Decision Engine, such as posting content, scheduling, or responding to comments.
- Implementing Agentic Features
  - **Task Manager**: Implement a task scheduler (e.g., Celery, APScheduler) to manage recurring or event-driven tasks. These tasks might include generating and posting content, monitoring trends, or responding to mentions.
  - **Decision Engine**: Integrate a rule-based or machine learning model to evaluate the best actions. For example, if a post about a trending topic performs well, the engine could decide to generate more content on similar topics.
  - **Monitoring Module**: Use APIs from social media platforms to gather data in real-time. This module can trigger the Task Manager to execute tasks based on certain conditions (e.g., a spike in mentions).
  - **Execution Engine**: Develop APIs or use existing SDKs to automate the execution of tasks, such as posting to social media or sending alerts.
- Examples of Agentic Workflows
  - **Automated Content Workflow**: The assistant could autonomously create, refine, and schedule posts based on a content calendar and current events, with minimal user input.
  - **Engagement Workflow**: An agent could monitor user interactions and automatically reply, like, or follow users based on predefined rules or using sentiment analysis.
  - **Performance Optimization Workflow**: The agent could continuously monitor post performance, adjusting future content generation strategies to optimize for engagement, reach, or conversions.
