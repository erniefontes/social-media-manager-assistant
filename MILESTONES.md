# Milestones

This document outlines the key milestones towards achieving the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Social Media Manager Assistant. # Roadmap to MVP: Social Media Manager Assistant with Open WebUI Integration

## Phase 1: Core Functionality Development (Weeks 1-3)

### Week 1: Project Setup and Basic Components
1. Set up project structure and version control
2. Implement basic `llm_handler.py`
   - Integrate with chosen LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) using LangChain
   - Create functions for sending prompts and receiving responses
3. Develop `database_handler.py`
   - Set up SQLite database for storing profile information
   - Implement basic CRUD operations for profiles and posts

### Week 2: Profile Management and Post Generation
1. Implement `profile_manager.py`
   - Create functions to add, edit, and delete profiles
   - Develop methods to associate posts with profiles
2. Develop `post_generator.py`
   - Create algorithm to generate posts based on previous content and given topic
   - Implement function to maintain consistent voice across posts
3. Integrate ChromaDB for vector storage of previous posts

### Week 3: Main Application and Testing
1. Develop `main.py`
   - Implement CLI interface for interacting with the assistant
   - Integrate all components (LLM, database, profile manager, post generator)
2. Write unit tests for all components
3. Perform integration testing
4. Debug and refine core functionality

## Phase 2: Open WebUI Integration (Weeks 4-5)

### Week 4: Open WebUI Extension Development
1. Set up Open WebUI development environment
2. Create `webui_integration.py`
   - Implement functions to expose core functionality to Open WebUI
   - Develop data serialization/deserialization methods
3. Develop Open WebUI extension
   - Create `script.py` with basic UI components
   - Implement functions to call core application functionality

### Week 5: Integration and Testing
1. Integrate Open WebUI extension with core application
2. Implement error handling and user feedback in WebUI
3. Update `main.py` to support both CLI and WebUI modes
4. Write tests for WebUI integration
5. Perform end-to-end testing of the integrated system
6. Debug and refine WebUI integration

## Phase 3: MVP Refinement and Documentation (Week 6)

### Week 6: Final Touches and Documentation
1. Refine user interface (both CLI and WebUI)
2. Optimize performance
3. Implement basic authentication for WebUI (if required)
4. Update README.md with final installation and usage instructions
5. Create comprehensive USAGE.md
6. Document known limitations and future improvement areas
7. Perform final round of testing
8. Prepare for MVP release

## Post-MVP Considerations

This roadmap provides a structured approach to reaching MVP, focusing first on core functionality, then integrating with Open WebUI, and finally refining the product for release. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation for the Social Media Manager Assistant.

Following MVP, the ROADMAP.md will be re-evaluated for next steps.
